OH good, IT IS GRIEF!
Again, at 12:something AM.
A tired curiousity wonders where we may have gone
though i barely remember where we went
Your best friend, now mine; i was yours, she was yours, but you were hers -- not to be mine.
That curiousity lingers, and I'll give it "possessive"
and so is she, and you, and I.
I don't think that'd be so if we'd known you'd die.
