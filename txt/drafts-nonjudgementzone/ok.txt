I always found comfort in the idea that we live in the best possible universe. My younger-self carried closely the mantra, "what happened is the only thing that could have happened; it is worthless to consider the alternatives." This would ease my anxiety, allowing me to thrive as an exceptionally stressed young adult.This later drew me toward stoicism. Reading Voltaire's <i> Candide </i> as a seventeen year old changed my life. I found validation in this thought, and a new sort of intellectual confidence. The same that inspires me as a writer, drafting this piece now.
