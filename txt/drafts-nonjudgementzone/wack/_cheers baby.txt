prost!
the loud big sound of a sweet bound crowd 
you fill my heart with something
big and loud an overwhelming sound
thumping thumping thumping 
tensions tuned out and smiles around
this really feels like something
like something i've known
maybe a while ago…




mercy, mercy, mercy
it feels like something sought for some time
still not easily made plain
finding, learning, easing
failed to elicit that something - - -
(of course, sans subjectivity)
my heart accepts procedure
for they hold something like that something
and with no room for error in rocket surgery
seek safety in knowledge
and protection in numbers
armed alone amnesty




although
for someone to pass me a napkin
or tell me something's on my face
maintains something better
than knowledge built from suffering,
i’ve got equipment in my belt,
instead of something else,
and it's more likely that i'll shrink 
or to be found absently emoting
nothing nothing nothing
but not one or two or three of you
can spare a night for me
this is what you'll find in love
in which you bury what you need
