I was introduced to the idea to even seek out this episode of David Letterman by a sort of friend I got to know because he was letting my short-term boyfriend (and so, me, too) stay with him for a moment. Some 3am, I woke up from a marijuana-induced nap to find this super sweet guy I barely knew smoking a bowl, watching videos recorded the day he was born published by strangers and archived on YouTube. That night, he, my boyfriend, and I watched some Floridian high school student documenting their day on a Sony Handycam, which reminded me of my own attempted video diary phase enabled by an authentic Sony Handycam manufactured in the early 2000s which I purchased from E-Bay. The student took us through the halls of their high school, interacted authentically. I'm going to find out his birthday and show that video too.
